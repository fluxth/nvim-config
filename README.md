# nvim-config

This is my personal neovim configuration.

- maintained as a patchset on top of [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
and will be rebased periodically.
- previous iterations of this config are historized by
[git tags](https://github.com/fluxth/nvim-config/tags) and
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/fluxth/nvim-config/releases).
